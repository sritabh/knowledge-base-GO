It has been mentioned that the BVR has been taken by invoking the provisions\ncontained in Section 26 (1) (b) of LARR Act, 2013 and steps has been initiated to pass\nawards by invoking the provisions contained in LARR Act, 2013\n\n4. The District Collector, Kottayam in the letter dated 28.02.2021 referred 6th above has\ninformed that land value @ Rs 9,36,978/- Are determined as per proceedings No 01-\n5974/12 dated 01.10.19 is strictly based on the provisions contained in Section 26 (1) (b)\nof LARR Act, 2013 and there is no defect.\n\n5. An enquiry has been conducted through Shri G Balachandran Pillai, Revenue\nInspector & Shri Sreejith Chandrasekharan, Revenue Inspector and the enquiry report\nforwarded by CLR as per the reference 7th cited revealed that all sale deeds similar to the\n\u2018land type' of land acquired and executed within a specific period are not taken into\naccount for valuation purposes. It has also been revealed that there is ambiguity in the\nassessment of market value under Section 26 of the LARR Act, 2013. As per the D.O No\n40/2021/PrlSecy(Rev) dated 26.04.2021 referred 8th above based on the enquiry report\nsubmitted by CLR, the following directions were issued to the District Collector,\nKottayam.\n\n(1) The valuation has been done under Section 26(1)(b) of the LARR Act, 2013 but the\nsale deeds of all similar types of land in the nearest village or near vicinity area have not\nbeen considered as provided in the said Act.\n\n(11) During the period from 25.06.2010 to 25.06.2013, the number of sale deeds executed\nin Meenachil SRO in respect of Lalam and Puliyanoor Villages as 638 and 1538\nrespectively. But only 8 deeds in total are considered for determination of award. No\naction was taken by the Tahsildar to find the deeds of similar type of lands from the said\n2176 sale deeds and to consider all of them for valuation. This, in turn, is contrary to the\nprovisions of the Act.\n\n(111) The report stated that the Tahsildar had carried out the valuation of the land following\nvarious precedents and certain procedures in the Acquisition act of 1894. Examples\ninclude the exclusion of sale deeds that are less than 10 cents, and the exclusion of some\n\fG.O.(Rt) No.2351/2022/RD\n\nsale deeds with the assumption that the consideration recorded in such deeds are very high\nand are transacted on fancy prices. If the lands involved in all such sale deeds are similar\nto the land being acquired, then the sale price mentioned therein must be considered for\nvaluation under the LARR Act, 2013.\n\n6. The District Collector, Kottayam was informed that if the award in this case is\napproved, it is proposed to rectify it by taking suo mottu action under section 33 of the\nLARR Act, 2013. If the award has not yet been approved, the Tahsildar should be\ninstructed to rectify the short comings mentioned above and re-determine the land value.\n\n7. As per Proceedings No G1-5974/12 dated 26.11.2021 referred 9th above the BVR\n(land value) has been redetermined as 9,50,694/-. Dissatisfied with the BVR rate Shri\nSajan P M has filed Review Petition u/s 36 of LARR Act, 2013 as per the reference 10th\nabove to stay all further proceedings in furtherance of No G1-5974/12 dated 26.11.2021.\n\n8. As authorized by the Additional Chief Secretary, Revenue, the Deputy Secretary\nheard the petitioner on 17.01.2022 by invoking the Ist proviso to section 36 of LARRAct,\n2013. After perusal of all documents the Hearing Officer came to the following\nconclusions:\n\n(1) It is necessary to seek an explanation from the officials who prepared the BVR and\npassed the award.\n\n(11) To collect details of all sale deeds of the same type executed in the near vicinity\narea and adjoining village of the land in question during the period from 25.06.2010 to\n25.06.2013 and to re-determine the compensation under section 26(1) (b) of the 2013 Act\non that basis.\n\n(111) To bring the above facts to the notice of AG, Ernakulam\n\n9. As per the letter referred 11th above, the District Collector, Kottayam was directed to\nseek an explanation from the officials who prepared the BVR. Further it was directed to\ncollect details of all sale deeds of the same type executed in the near vicinity area and\nadjoining village of the land in question during the period from 25.06.2010 to 25.06.2013\nand to re-determine the compensation under section 26(1) (b) of the LARR Act, 2013.\n\n10. The District Collector, Kottayam as per the letter referred 12th above has\nforwarded the Proceedings No G1-5974/12 dated 19.05.2022 redetermining the BVR as\nRs 10,14,309/-.\n\n11. It is observed that the Special Tahsildar has re-determined the market value in\ncomplete rejection of the Government's direction. The said section 26 (1) (b) 1s added\nbelow:\n\n\u201c26 (1) (b)- The average sale price for similar type of land situated 11 the nearest Village\nor near vicinity area\u2019\u201d\n\n12. Nowhere in the Act is there any provision to compare the commercial value or\nroad access of similar type of lands taken into account for the valuation of the land to be\nacquired. Section 26 of the Act stipulates that only the average of the market value\nmentioned in the deeds of all similar type of land executed within three years in the Near\nvicinity or in the nearest Village should be taken into account. In this way, even the price\nof land in the nearby Villages can be taken into account, and the omission of deeds with\nhigh consideration (sales value) in reference to distance, commercial significance and road\naccess 1s seen as illegal and contrary to the principle of fair compensation mentioned in\nthe Act. It is therefore imperative that a comprehensive enquiry into this matter is carried\nout.\n\n13. Government have examined the matter in detail and hereby constitute an enquiry\n\fG.O.(Rt) No.2351/2022/RD\n\nteam with the following members to enquire in the re-determination of land value (BVR)\ndone with regard to the acquisition of 5.47 Ares of land in Re Sy No 7/33-1, 7/44-lof\nPuliyanoor Village for the construction of parallel road from R V Junction to Puliyanoor\nin Pala, Kottayam.\n\nI.
