GOVERNMENT OF KERALA
Abstract

Higher Education - KIIFB - Authorising ASAP to constitute Project
Monitoring Unit for inspecting the progress of KIIFB works under Higher
Education Department - Sanctioned - Orders issued.

HIGHER EDUCATION DEPARTMENT
G.O.(Rt)No.1335/2020/HEDN Dated, Thiruvananthapuram, 23/10/2020

The Chief Executive Officer, KIIFB in its meeting has explained
that in some of the KHFB works undertaken in Government
Departments, are poor quality of work by the Contractor and poor
supervision by the SPV's. This is happen due to the absence of
technical personnel on site as agreed to by the SPV. KIIFB wanted
every Department to have Nodal Officers who will inspect all the
works and certify the presence of the prescribed technical personnel on
site on the day of the visit. Such a group of Nodal Officers will
constitute a Project Management Unit or PMU for inspecting the
progress of KIIFB works.

In the circumstances, Government have decided to constitute a
Project Management Unit (PMU) by appointing Nodal Officers in each
District for evaluating the progress of KIIFB works and to ensure the
presence of the prescribed technical personnel on site inspection. For
constituting Project Management Unit (PMU), Government hereby
authorise the Chief Executive Officer of ASAP to select eligible
Programme Managers from ASAP, preferably a Civil Engineer (one
person in each District) for constituting Project Management Unit
(PMU). The selection of the above personnel shall be based on_ their
willingness and capability of Project Managers in the District (DDM's,
CSP, A/SDC. PM's) as assessed by the Chief Executive Officer, ASAP
and the Director of Collegiate Education.

The Nodal Officer will have to give an undertaking every 15
days after inspection. The inspection shall focus on the presence of the

undertaking should be countersigned by the Principal. 14 Nodal
