informed that steps has been initiated by the LAO to hear the petitioner and BVR has been
approved as per the proceedings referred 4th above, fixing the land value @ Rs 9,36,978/-
Are. It has been mentioned that the BVR has been taken by invoking the provisions
contained in Section 26 (1) (b) of LARR Act, 2013 and steps has been initiated to pass
awards by invoking the provisions contained in LARR Act, 2013

4. The District Collector, Kottayam in the letter dated 28.02.2021 referred 6th above has
informed that land value @ Rs 9,36,978/- Are determined as per proceedings No 01-
5974/12 dated 01.10.19 is strictly based on the provisions contained in Section 26 (1) (b)
of LARR Act, 2013 and there is no defect.

5. An enquiry has been conducted through Shri G Balachandran Pillai, Revenue
Inspector & Shri Sreejith Chandrasekharan, Revenue Inspector and the enquiry report
forwarded by CLR as per the reference 7th cited revealed that all sale deeds similar to the
‘land type' of land acquired and executed within a specific period are not taken into
account for valuation purposes. It has also been revealed that there is ambiguity in the
assessment of market value under Section 26 of the LARR Act, 2013. As per the D.O No
40/2021/PrlSecy(Rev) dated 26.04.2021 referred 8th above based on the enquiry report
submitted by CLR, the following directions were issued to the District Collector,
Kottayam.

(1) The valuation has been done under Section 26(1)(b) of the LARR Act, 2013 but the
sale deeds of all similar types of land in the nearest village or near vicinity area have not
been considered as provided in the said Act.

(11) During the period from 25.06.2010 to 25.06.2013, the number of sale deeds executed
in Meenachil SRO in respect of Lalam and Puliyanoor Villages as 638 and 1538
respectively. But only 8 deeds in total are considered for determination of award. No
action was taken by the Tahsildar to find the deeds of similar type of lands from the said
2176 sale deeds and to consider all of them for valuation. This, in turn, is contrary to the
provisions of the Act.

(111) The report stated that the Tahsildar had carried out the valuation of the land following
various precedents and certain procedures in the Acquisition act of 1894. Examples
include the exclusion of sale deeds that are less than 10 cents, and the exclusion of some
G.O.(Rt) No.2351/2022/RD

sale deeds with the assumption that the consideration recorded in such deeds are very high
and are transacted on fancy prices. If the lands involved in all such sale deeds are similar
to the land being acquired, then the sale price mentioned therein must be considered for
valuation under the LARR Act, 2013.

6. The District Collector, Kottayam was informed that if the award in this case is
approved, it is proposed to rectify it by taking suo mottu action under section 33 of the
LARR Act, 2013. If the award has not yet been approved, the Tahsildar should be
instructed to rectify the short comings mentioned above and re-determine the land value.

7. As per Proceedings No G1-5974/12 dated 26.11.2021 referred 9th above the BVR
(land value) has been redetermined as 9,50,694/-. Dissatisfied with the BVR rate Shri
Sajan P M has filed Review Petition u/s 36 of LARR Act, 2013 as per the reference 10th
above to stay all further proceedings in furtherance of No G1-5974/12 dated 26.11.2021.

8. As authorized by the Additional Chief Secretary, Revenue, the Deputy Secretary
heard the petitioner on 17.01.2022 by invoking the Ist proviso to section 36 of LARRAct,
2013. After perusal of all documents the Hearing Officer came to the following
conclusions:

(1) It is necessary to seek an explanation from the officials who prepared the BVR and
passed the award.

(11) To collect details of all sale deeds of the same type executed in the near vicinity
area and adjoining village of the land in question during the period from 25.06.2010 to
25.06.2013 and to re-determine the compensation under section 26(1) (b) of the 2013 Act
on that basis.

(111) To bring the above facts to the notice of AG, Ernakulam

9. As per the letter referred 11th above, the District Collector, Kottayam was directed to
seek an explanation from the officials who prepared the BVR. Further it was directed to
collect details of all sale deeds of the same type executed in the near vicinity area and
adjoining village of the land in question during the period from 25.06.2010 to 25.06.2013
and to re-determine the compensation under section 26(1) (b) of the LARR Act, 2013.

10. The District Collector, Kottayam as per the letter referred 12th above has
forwarded the Proceedings No G1-5974/12 dated 19.05.2022 redetermining the BVR as
Rs 10,14,309/-.

11. It is observed that the Special Tahsildar has re-determined the market value in
complete rejection of the Government's direction. The said section 26 (1) (b) 1s added
below:

“26 (1) (b)- The average sale price for similar type of land situated 11 the nearest Village
or near vicinity area’”

12. Nowhere in the Act is there any provision to compare the commercial value or
road access of similar type of lands taken into account for the valuation of the land to be
acquired. Section 26 of the Act stipulates that only the average of the market value
mentioned in the deeds of all similar type of land executed within three years in the Near
vicinity or in the nearest Village should be taken into account. In this way, even the price
of land in the nearby Villages can be taken into account, and the omission of deeds with
high consideration (sales value) in reference to distance, commercial significance and road
access 1s seen as illegal and contrary to the principle of fair compensation mentioned in
the Act. It is therefore imperative that a comprehensive enquiry into this matter is carried
out.

13. Government have examined the matter in detail and hereby constitute an enquiry
G.O.(Rt) No.2351/2022/RD

done with regard to the acquisition of 5.47 Ares of land in Re Sy No 7/33-1, 7/44-lof
